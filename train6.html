            <p>The ICE 4, part of Germany's Intercity-Express (ICE) fleet operated by Deutsche Bahn, is a modern, high-speed train designed for flexibility, energy efficiency, and enhanced passenger comfort. Introduced in 2017, the ICE 4 serves as the backbone of Germany’s high-speed network, connecting major cities such as Berlin, Munich, and Hamburg. Operating at a maximum speed of 250 km/h (155 mph), the ICE 4 prioritizes energy efficiency with lightweight materials and regenerative braking systems, reducing environmental impact.

                Inside, the ICE 4 offers spacious seating in both First and Second Class, family compartments, bicycle storage, and accessible amenities for passengers with reduced mobility. It also features onboard Wi-Fi, power outlets, and improved sound insulation, providing a quiet and comfortable journey. The modular design allows the train to be adapted for different route demands, with configurations ranging from 7 to 13 cars, making it highly versatile for both domestic and cross-border routes. The ICE 4’s advanced engineering and passenger-focused design underscore Deutsche Bahn's commitment to sustainable, efficient, and reliable high-speed rail travel across Europe.</p>

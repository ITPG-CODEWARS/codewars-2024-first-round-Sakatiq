            <p>The SNCF TGV Duplex is a double-decker, high-speed train that serves as a cornerstone of France’s TGV fleet, renowned for its ability to carry a high volume of passengers efficiently and comfortably. First introduced in 1996, the TGV Duplex can travel at speeds of up to 320 km/h (199 mph) and is distinguished by its bi-level structure, accommodating up to 508 passengers—almost 40% more than single-deck TGV trains. Designed for long-distance travel, the Duplex operates on major domestic routes as well as international lines to neighboring countries such as Switzerland, Germany, and Spain. 

                Inside, the TGV Duplex offers a spacious layout with quiet zones, family areas, and seating that includes both upper and lower levels for varied views and travel experiences. Its aerodynamic design reduces energy consumption, making it one of the most eco-friendly options in high-speed rail travel. The TGV Duplex represents both technological and engineering excellence, solidifying France's position as a leader in high-speed rail transport.</p>
